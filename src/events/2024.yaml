    🍻 Calling all Bitcoiners and beer lovers 🍻


    Hey there!


    Last year's beer bash on the terrace of Paralelní Polis was an absolute
    blast, wasn't it? Oh yes, last year we couldn't resist a cheeky glance over
    at our Ethereum friends 😏, and let's just say, it was quite the spectacle.


    Well, guess what? We're doing it again, and this time it's going to be even
    better!


    Join us on Sunday, June 16th, for a laid-back, post-conference hangout where
    Bitcoiners from near and far can come together and unwind before heading
    back to reality.


    So mark your calendars, spread the word, and get ready to raise a glass to
    another unforgettable evening in the epicenter of Prague's crypto scene.


    See you there! ⚡

    ##### **Welcome to the 3rd annual Pizza Day Prague!**


    As we gather once again to celebrate the evolution of Bitcoin and its impact
    on our world, this year’s conference explores a crucial battleground.


    The Scaling Wars represent a pivotal moment in Bitcoin’s journey, a battle
    to address the growing pains and ensure the continued relevance of
    peer-to-peer electronic cash. As the demand for Bitcoin transactions rises,
    questions about network capacity, transaction speed, and fees become
    increasingly urgent. The decentralization ethos that underpins Bitcoin’s
    essence faces challenges as the community navigates the delicate balance
    between scalability and maintaining the trustless nature of the network.


    The Scaling Wars encompass not only technical considerations but also
    ideological discussions about the very soul of Bitcoin. Should we prioritize
    on-chain scaling or explore layer-two solutions? How do we ensure
    inclusivity and avoid centralization without compromising efficiency?


    Together, we can navigate the challenges of scaling, foster innovation, and
    ensure that the original spirit of Bitcoin thrives in the face of adversity.
    Join us in Prague for Pizza Day 2024 – where the aroma of freshly baked
    ideas and the zest of intellectual exchange promise to make this a landmark
    event in the ongoing saga of Bitcoin’s evolution.

    Vstupte do světa, kde se hranice komfortní zóny neznají limit a domov je
    tam, kde otevřete laptop 🌴


    Jmenuji se Denisa a zvu vás na přednášku ‘Za hranicemi komfortní zóny i
    domova: Život v Panamě’, kde se podělím o svůj příběh odvahy, adaptability a
    nekonečného objevování 🤩


    Připravte se na průvodce životem, který je stejně neotřelý a otevřený, jako
    jsem já – od pražských ulic a sterilních officů až do srdce Latinské
    Ameriky, můžu vám rozšířit pohled na nový způsob myšlení a práce. Na této
    cestě prozkoumáme, jaké to je žít v Panamě, vzdorovat kultuře jako cizinec
    👀, navigovat byrokracií a korupci 💸, a zároveň objevovat krásu tropického
    raje 🦥🌴.


    Sdílím s vámi, jak se dá využít remote práce a AI k vytvoření života bez
    omezení ✨. Budete mít možnost nahlédnout do zákulisí indiánských kultur,
    politických intrik a skutečného života v džungli s notebookem 👩🏼‍💻 Tato
    přednáška vám otevře oči a možná i dveře k vaší vlastní cestě za hranice
    běžného.


    Přijďte objevit, jak můžete změnit svůj život, rozšířit obzory a možná najít
    inspiraci k tomu, abyste i vy udělali ten první krok za hranici komfortní
    zóny🚀


    Těším se na vás a na sdílení těchto inspirativních okamžiků 🪐

    There are many reasons users need private and secure internet.


    In this two-part event we’ll introduce the Nym mixnet, a cutting-edge
    decentralized privacy system that makes traffic anonymous. The Nym mixnet
    encrypts your data and, with unique 5-hop traffic shuffling, also protects
    your patterns of communication: your metadata.


    And we’ll run and test NymVPN, a client that makes the mixnet accessible to
    anyone.


    Whether you’re running MacOS or Linux, bring your laptop and join a live
    workshop where you can connect with other privacy enthusiasts - and help us
    build the future private internet, free from surveillance.

    **PAPER JAM \| Využití AI na pozici IT juniora**


    Jak využít AI pro rozjezd kariéry v IT a pokecat si u toho s ostatníma
    holkama? Zveme vás na networking event do Paralelní Polis - technologického
    hubu, který v sobě spojuje coworking, eventový prostor a kavárnu, která jako
    první na světě přijímala bitcoin.


    Fandíme jak ženám, tak novým, neotřelým nápadům. Proto se večer ponese ve
    znaku přednášek o chat GPT, mentoringu v oblasti nových technologií a
    přínosu coworkingové komunity pro ženy pracující na volné noze.
    Přednášejícími jsou profesionálové z Czechitas, React Girls a Femme Palette.
    Součástí události bude i neformální networking, kde si účastnice mohou
    vyměnit znalosti a zkušenosti nebo navázat nová partnerství. Samozřejmostí
    jsou i bublinky na uvítanou.
