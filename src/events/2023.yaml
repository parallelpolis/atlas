    Dear friends of technology, cryptoanarchy, and tea culture!


    This time Monero Tea has prepared for you not a meetup, but a pre-Christmas
    bazaar of stylish clothes, board games, electronics, and much more (a free
    roasted kyobancha will accompany every purchase) and a free friendly
    discussion on the topic of crypto and AI.


    We'll meet at Paralelní Polis on December 15 at 3 PM. Feel free to join,
    chat, have a good hot tea, or give a raised middle finger to Gresham's Law
    and buy some cool stuff from our crypto bazaar – for yourself or your loved
    ones.


    If you have time, you can also stick around for the [Parallel Xmas
    Party](https://www.meetup.com/paralelnipolis/events/296831033/), which
    immediately follows our event!

    For over 5000 years, an underground war has played out between state
    civilization and free society.


    This war is not merely a physical one, but a spiritual war.

    Today the struggle continues. Life evolves and moves upwards through the
    efforts of society. The state as a parasite harvests this human energy for
    its own survival.


    But grand events are playing out. The pendulum swings towards freedom. This
    is the hour. Cyber-guerillas rise up!


    **RESISTANCE IS LIFE!**


    Speakers line-up includes Richard Stallman, Cody Wilson, Jarrad Hope, Ryan
    Lackey, Rachel-Rose O'Leary, Mitch Altman, Bob Summerwill, Paul Rosenberg,
    Silke Noa, Harry Halpin, Max Hillebrand, Scott Beibin and many more!

    **[hcpp.cz](http://hcpp.cz/)**

    *[Hackers Congress Paralelní Polis](https://1337.hcpp.cz/) (HCPP) is the
    flagship event of Paralelní Polis, which since 2014 has been regularly
    attended by over 500 fans and IT experts from all over the world. HCPP is
    held annually in Prague on the first weekend of October.*


    *The main thematic pillars of the three-day congress are Freedom &
    Cryptoanarchy, Decentralized Economics, & Cryptocurrencies, Political Art &
    Hacking, and Science & Technology.*

    Join us for the launch of Holešky testnet watching party from Bordel
    Hackerspace located in actual Prague 7, Holešovice. The original launch
    during Protocol Berg failed and the next attempt ( 😏 ) is planned for
    September 28th, 14:00 CEST.


    We will meet in the hackerspace, which already served as a slayer of the
    Ropsten testnet, to witness the launch of the first long-standing,
    merged-from-genesis, public Ethereum testnet. Holešky will replace Goerli as
    a staking, infrastructure, and protocol-developer testnet maintained by the
    community. The name comes Holešovice, part of Prague where the hackerspace
    is located which makes it the best place to witness its genesis.

    technologie, společenské změny a ekonomické modely. Vize, která mění způsob,
    jakým vnímáme státy a společnost, a posouvá nás směrem k decentralizaci a
    globální spolupráci.

    Protocol Berg is a novel summit providing a location specifically for protocol research, decentralized infrastructure, and core-developer experience. The one-day event with two stages, opportunities for technical workshops, and protocol community gatherings brings together protocol researchers and other stakeholders from different decentralized protocols. Attendance is free of charge. The event will not host any sponsors or commercial talks.
  description: |
    Protocol Berg was a one-day technical conference targeting an audience of protocol/system/network engineers, decentralized-infrastructure administrators, researchers, and other curious minds. Protocol Berg aimed to bring distributed technology ecosystems together to exchange concepts and technology, talk about shared open problems, and learn from each other.

    Topics covered by the event orbited mainly around consensus protocols, distributed virtual machines, peer-to-peer networking, decentralized infrastructure, open-source governance, and protocol research.

    We welcomed 650 attendees, and tickets were free, as in free lemonade. All attendees had to adhere to the event's Code of Conduct.

    Protocol Berg was a donation-backed, non-profit event. Therefore, there were no sponsors.

    **Paralelní Polis brings you another Pizza Day Prague!**


    **The pizza-2-pizza conference is a call to arms for advocates of Bitcoin as
    peer-to-peer technology.**


    A dozen years have passed since the first trade of pizza for Bitcoin. Today,
    we celebrate the widespread popularity and adoption of this delicious dish.
    It has been embraced by individuals, businesses, and even national
    governments. We are truly witnessing the rise of the hyper-pizzanization of
    our world.


    Yet, just as the pizza industry has evolved from sit-down restaurants to
    delivery services to frozen pizzas, the Bitcoin ecosystem has similarly
    moved from face-to-face transactions to third-party intermediaries. But just
    as frozen pizzas can never truly replace the experience of a freshly-made
    pie, third parties can never fully replace the trustless nature of P2P
    transactions.


    We believe that by using Bitcoin as intended, a peer-to-peer electronic cash
    system, we can create a more secure, efficient, and fair financial system.
    We reject the need for third parties and spofs, and extol cryptography to
    empower truly trustless systems. P2P technologies not only enable more
    robust and smooth economic structures, but most importantly they bring
    global coordination without the need for hierarchies. Still, we must resist
    the temptation to build walls and instead strive to create bridges,
    fostering a culture of technological meritocracy and collaboration.


    As contemporary cypherpunks, it is our duty to fight for the ideals of
    decentralization and trustlessness in the face of challenges from
    governments, the public, and even within our own communities. As Bitcoin
    allows us to connect directly with one another without the need for trusted
    third parties, so too can we envision a future where pizza enthusiasts can
    savor their favorite dish without intermediaries.


    Join us in the fight for a decentralized future where the power of
    peer-to-peer technology enables true pizza freedom for all. Let us embrace
    the power of the pizza-to-pizza revival and celebrate the genuine spirit of
    the original Bitcoin pizza transaction.

    Are you fascinated by the way ideas spread and shape human behavior? Do you
    want to gain a deeper understanding of the cultural forces that shape our
    world? Then join us for a Memetics Meetup!


    Memetics is the study of how ideas, beliefs, and cultural practices spread
    from person to person. It’s a way of understanding how human consciousness
    is shaped by the memes that surround us – from the catchy songs that get
    stuck in our heads, to the political slogans that shape our beliefs.


    But memetics isn’t just about understanding how things spread. It’s also
    about understanding how we can hack the system around us. By understanding
    how memes work, we can learn to create more powerful and effective ideas and
    spread them more efficiently. This is especially important in today’s world,
    where the way we think and act is increasingly shaped by the digital world.


    We’ll have a great time discussing the latest research and theories about
    memetics, and you’ll leave with a deeper understanding of how human
    consciousness works. See you there!

    Join us for the KZG Summoning Ceremony, where we will delve into the depths
    of computational multiparty rituals to summon the elusive spirit of
    Dankshard.


    At the heart of this ceremony lies a powerful device that harvests
    randomness, drawing from the chaotic sources that lurk within our universe.
    Using a specially designed contraption that collects entropy from the feline
    species, we will explore the limits of our understanding of randomness and
    harness its power to unlock the mysteries of Ethereum's scalability.


    This will not be an ordinary workshop, as we push the boundaries of what is
    possible and venture into the unknown. As we summon the spirit of Dankshard,
    humans may find themselves transformed into feline avatars, blurring the
    lines between reality and fantasy. So join us, and prepare to unlock the
    secrets of the universe as we delve into the space of chaos and cats.

    Paralelní Polis origins in a concept developed during communist regime
    oppression in 70´and 80´in Czechoslovakia. However, the core principles
    appear throughout the whole history of humankind. Even though we live in a
    “digital age” the history of parallel societies gives us a very rich source
    of inspiration, strategies, and tips on how to prevent our lives from
    unwanted interference of power holders. Paralelní polis itself has operated
    for eight years already and experimented with many many ways parallel
    society can and can not work – let´s recapitulate some lessons learned.


    Martin Leskovjan is a co-founder of Paralelní Polis, InfoSec professional,
    lawyer, literature geek, and wild water lover.


    You will have a unique opportunity to meet Martin and ask him anything you
    want at this meetup!

    This regular meetup on security and privacy is more practically oriented.
    You can look forward to talks on the issues of data protection on the
    Internet, techniques to prevent data collection by big browsers (Google),
    and other techniques to protect privacy in the online space. The meetup
    takes the form of a discussion, Q&A and, if interested, practical
    demonstrations, so we recommend bringing your own computer.
