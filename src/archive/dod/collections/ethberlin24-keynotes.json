However: centralisation lasts until the next Elon, whereas decentralisation can last forever.\n\nIn this talk, I'll explain the challenges we've hit in building Matrix to compete with the mainstream alternatives, how we're solving them, why it's taken so long, and why it's more important than ever to keep the ideal of decentralised communication alive.\n\nETHBerlin04 - https://ethberlin.org\r\nA Department of Decentralization event - https://dod.ngo",

We are not the first people in history to try that, so what happened before? This talk will look at some historical attempts to create systems and societies that do not depend on government or institutional power, from the Diggers to the Free Software movement. Then we will look at tools and techniques we can use to govern and sustain crypto-economic systems and talk about how to increase their impact and protect them against bribery, cooption and destruction.\n\nETHBerlin04 - https://ethberlin.org\r\nA Department of Decentralization event - https://dod.ngo",

We show how despite verifying humans, hidden pools rapidly emerged—some cooperative, but most controlled by “puppeteers” who, at best, remunerated participants for periodically proving their uniqueness in exchange for access to their secret keys and controlling their accounts. Instead of fostering an egalitarian network of unique identities, the protocol fractured into hidden subnetworks vying for control over an economic pie with economies of scale trending towards oligopoly, undermining the protocol's security and ambitions for democratic governance (one-person, one-vote) and UBI rewards (one-person, one reward). By giving humans economic incentives to periodically differentiate themselves from bots, the protocol gave more informed, resourceful humans financial incentives to puppeteer less informed humans like bots.\n\nETHBerlin04 - https://ethberlin.org\r\nA Department of Decentralization event - https://dod.ngo",
