    Pontus and Ulrika sold all their stuff in 2015 after finishing their PhD’s
    at the Medical faculty in Linköping Sweden and have since then been
    travelling the world to meet up with fellow Bitcoiners and libertarians.


    At the meetup they will talk about their background, minimalist lifestyle,
    why the current economic system is something you want to opt out from and
    why they chose Bitcoin as their primary currency...


    Meetup will be held in English and will be streamed in the Facebook event.
    Entrance fee in BTC or LTC is voluntary and welcome >
